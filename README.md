# X18SE-FRSKY-bind-to-Frsky-receiver
Was having bind trouble/trouble getting beta flight to talk to Speedybee-TX800 ESC
before issue started, I was trying to use a frsky taranis lite with d16. The radio was already being used for one other receiver. I created a new model and tried to bind with new quad build. 
The process used to bind older frsky with frsky R-XSR: 
Get your radio into bind mode. read up on that. Its not hard.
While radio is in bind mode and chirping...
hold f/s button on receiver (the little button on the R-XSR is called the F/S button)...keep f/s button held down when plugging the lipo battery to power the esc. You should hear a beep or two and continue holding the F/S button. Do not stop pressing the F/S button until you unplug the drone power. 
I think the lights on the receiver should have started out being red and blue or flashing red and blue. The process is online so be sure to reference that for verification. 
This memo is only to share my issues and help someone who might be having the same issue or related. 
I digress. Once the lights on the receiver, have gone from what they were to a solid green or blue or whatever mode you are on while binding (and you should probably read about the two diff programs on the receiver...sbus and Frsky F port) unplug the power conncetor from the drone, then release the F/S button. 
Back out of bind mode correctly per your transmitter/radio. Then power the radio down correctly. I say this becasue I am all about properly closing programs before just powering off a device. This process is crucial for the longevity and ease of use in relation to all of our computer devices.
Power the radio back on and be sure to have selected your new model that you just used to bind to the new receiver.
We are not binding again. This process is what is needed to verify that you have in fact completed the bind process for the radio transmitter to the receiver. 
Once your radio is on, plug the correct lipo battery into your drone and look at the receiver. It should not have any red lights on the receiver. 
Your radio (if equiped and on) should have an audible message to confirm that you are connected I think too. Please verify this. I am not a pro here. This is just my journal info to possibly help the struggling neww guy like so many did for me. 
Note/Tip: One of the times i was trying to plug power in alone, I was able to get the power from the battery without fulling plugging in the battery cord. It is tricky to do this alone unless you have large skilled hands. 
If you are a less fortunate person such as myself and did not get a successful bind. You can try to press and hold the f/s button to change to the other type of mode it has. Im not sure if its called a mode or program or function.... but whatever it is called, you can press and hold the f/s button for about 5-7 secs i found, then let go and it should change the light sequence to let you know the "mode" has changed. Then repeat the bind process. This worked for me. I hope this help.
